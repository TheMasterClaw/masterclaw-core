# MasterClaw Ecosystem Improvement - 2026-02-17

## Improvement #1: Added SSRF Protection to Domain Validation

**Focus Area**: Security Hardening

### What Was Missing
The `mc validate` command validated domain format but did not check for SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attack vectors. Users could unknowingly configure domains that:
- Resolve to private/internal IP addresses
- Use internal hostnames (kubernetes, docker, localhost variants)
- Contain DNS rebinding patterns that bypass security controls

### What Was Added

Enhanced `lib/validate.js` with comprehensive SSRF protection:

1. **Private IP Detection**
   - Loopback: 127.0.0.0/8, ::1
   - Private networks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
   - Link-local: 169.254.0.0/16
   - IPv6 unique local: fc00::/7
   - IPv6 link-local: fe80::/10

2. **Internal Hostname Detection**
   - localhost, internal, intranet, local
   - kubernetes, kube, docker, container, pod, svc, service
   - lan, home, router, gateway, nas, server

3. **Suspicious Pattern Detection**
   - .local TLD (mDNS - SSL won't work)
   - .internal, .lan, .home domains
   - Numeric subdomains (DNS rebinding indicators)
   - Invalid characters

4. **Integration with mc validate**
   - Warnings displayed during validation
   - Additional info messages for SSRF guidance
   - Proper error categorization

### Files Changed
- `masterclaw-tools/lib/validate.js` (+156 lines)
- `masterclaw-tools/tests/validate.ssrf.test.js` (new file, 311 lines, 36 tests)

### Commit
```
17fc354 feat(security): Add SSRF protection to domain validation
```

### Test Results
- 36 new SSRF-specific tests (all passing)
- 450 total tests passing (regression verified)

### Security Impact
- Prevents domains resolving to internal IPs in production
- Blocks DNS rebinding attack vectors
- Warns about non-publicly resolvable domains
- Provides actionable security guidance

## Improvement #2: Added `mc update` command to MasterClaw CLI

### What Was Missing
The `masterclaw-infrastructure` Makefile had a `make update` command that pulled latest Docker images and restarted services, but the CLI (`mc`) lacked equivalent functionality. This created an inconsistency where users had to use different tools for different update scenarios.

### What Was Added

Created `lib/update.js` - a comprehensive update management module with:

1. **Main update command** (`mc update`)
   - Pulls latest Docker images
   - Restarts services with new images
   - Checks CLI version against npm registry
   - Progress reporting with spinners
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **Check mode** (`mc update --check`)
   - Preview available updates without applying
   - Shows current vs latest CLI version
   - Lists running service images
   - Safe for CI/CD pipelines

3. **Dry-run mode** (`mc update --dry-run`)
   - Shows exactly what commands would execute
   - No actual changes made
   - Useful for automation and review

4. **Selective updates**
   - `--services`: Update Docker services only
   - `--cli-only`: Check CLI version only

5. **Version subcommand** (`mc update version`)
   - Shows current CLI version
   - Lists configured service versions from docker-compose.yml
   - `--json` output for automation

### Files Changed
- `masterclaw-tools/lib/update.js` (new file, 358 lines)
- `masterclaw-tools/bin/mc.js` (added import and registration)
- `masterclaw-tools/README.md` (added documentation)

### Commit
```
71c1ee9 feat(cli): add mc update command for service and CLI updates
```

### Why This Matters
- **Parity**: CLI now matches Makefile functionality
- **CI/CD**: Scriptable update checking and application
- **Safety**: Dry-run and check modes prevent surprises
- **Visibility**: Version command shows what's deployed
- **User Experience**: Single tool for all MasterClaw operations

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Check what updates are available
mc update --check

# Preview changes
mc update --dry-run

# Apply updates
mc update

# Show versions
mc update version
```

## Improvement #3: Added `mc notify` command for Notification Management

### What Was Missing
The `masterclaw-infrastructure` repository had `scripts/alert-webhook.sh` — a bash script that receives Alertmanager webhooks and dispatches to WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and Telegram. However, there was no CLI command to:
- Easily configure notification channels
- Check notification status across all channels
- Send test notifications to verify setup
- Manage which alert types to receive

Users had to manually edit `.env` files and use `make alert` or run the script directly.

### What Was Added

Created `lib/notify.js` - a comprehensive notification management module:

1. **Status command** (`mc notify status`)
   - Shows webhook server status (running/stopped)
   - Lists all notification channels with enabled/configured status
   - Displays active alert types
   - JSON output mode for automation

2. **Webhook server control** (`mc notify start|stop|restart`)
   - Starts/stops the alert webhook server
   - Configurable port via `--port`
   - Automatically updates `.env` with port setting

3. **Channel configuration** (`mc notify config <channel>`)
   - WhatsApp: `--number` for phone number
   - Discord: `--webhook` for webhook URL
   - Slack: `--webhook` for webhook URL
   - Telegram: `--token` and `--chat-id`
   - Saves to both JSON config and `.env` for compatibility

4. **Enable/disable channels** (`mc notify enable|disable <channel>`)
   - Toggle channel on/off without losing configuration

5. **Test notifications** (`mc notify test [channel]`)
   - Test all enabled channels or specific channel
   - Custom message and severity support
   - Auto-starts webhook if not running

6. **Alert type configuration** (`mc notify alerts`)
   - List available alert types
   - Enable/disable specific alerts:
     - `serviceDown` — When services become unhealthy
     - `sslExpiring` — SSL certificate expiration warnings
     - `highCost` — LLM usage cost thresholds
     - `securityThreat` — Detected security threats

### Files Changed
- `masterclaw-tools/lib/notify.js` (new file, 615 lines)
- `masterclaw-tools/bin/mc.js` (+2 lines: import and register notify command, bump version to 0.15.0)
- `masterclaw-tools/README.md` (+50 lines: documented new command)

### Commit
```
92958af feat: add mc notify command for notification channel management
```

### Why This Matters
- **Usability**: Users can now configure notifications through CLI instead of editing env files
- **Discoverability**: `mc notify status` shows exactly what's configured and what's missing
- **Testing**: Easy test notifications verify channels work before going to production
- **Completeness**: Fills the gap between the alert-webhook.sh infrastructure and CLI tooling
- **Consistency**: All notification management now available through the `mc` command

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Check current notification status
mc notify status

# Configure Discord notifications
mc notify config discord --webhook "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
mc notify enable discord

# Test the configuration
mc notify test discord

# Start receiving alerts
mc notify start

# Enable SSL expiration alerts
mc notify alerts --enable sslExpiring
```

## Improvement #4: Added Path Traversal Protection to Import Command

**Focus Area**: Security Hardening

### What Was Missing
The `mc import` command accepted file paths directly from user input without validating for path traversal attacks. This could allow an attacker to:
- Access files outside the intended directory (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- Import malicious files with dangerous extensions
- Cause DoS via extremely large import files
- Inject prototype pollution keys into the config system

### What Was Added

Enhanced `lib/import.js` with comprehensive security protections:

1. **Path Traversal Protection**
   - Validates file paths before access
   - Blocks `..` sequences and absolute path attacks
   - Uses existing `containsPathTraversal()` security utility
   - Logs security violations for audit

2. **File Size Limits (DoS Protection)**
   - Maximum import file size: 10MB
   - Prevents memory exhaustion attacks
   - File size checked before JSON parsing

3. **Extension Whitelist**
   - Only `.json` files allowed
   - Case-insensitive extension checking
   - Prevents execution of malicious scripts

4. **Prototype Pollution Prevention**
   - Detects `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys
   - Recursive sanitization of nested objects
   - Rejects dangerous keys during import

5. **Import Item Limits**
   - Maximum 10,000 memories per import
   - Prevents resource exhaustion
   - Validated before processing begins

6. **Rate Limiting Integration**
   - 10 imports per minute maximum
   - Prevents automated abuse
   - Uses existing rate limiter infrastructure

7. **Audit Logging**
   - Security violations logged with context
   - Path traversal attempts recorded
   - Integrated with `logSecurityViolation()`

### Files Changed
- `masterclaw-tools/lib/import.js` (+156 lines of security code)
- `masterclaw-tools/tests/import.security.test.js` (new file, 31 tests)
- `masterclaw-tools/README.md` (documented security features)

### Commit
```
50c365e feat(security): Add comprehensive path traversal protection to import command
```

### Test Results
- 31 new security-specific tests (all passing)
- 494 total tests passing (regression verified)
- Tests cover:
  - Path traversal attempts (9 test cases)
  - File size limits (4 test cases)
  - Prototype pollution (5 test cases)
  - Item count limits (3 test cases)
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions (6 test cases)

### Security Impact
- Prevents directory traversal attacks on import operations
- Blocks malicious file uploads and script execution
- Protects against prototype pollution attacks
- Provides audit trail for security events
- Maintains backward compatibility with valid imports

### Usage (unchanged)
```bash
# All imports now protected by security checks
mc import all ./backup.json
mc import config ./config.json
mc import memory ./memories.json
mc import validate ./file.json
```
